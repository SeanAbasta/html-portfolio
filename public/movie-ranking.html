<h1>The Best Movies According to Sean</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>

<p>If you liked the first movie, you're gonna love the sequel. <br />
    It's not mindblowing but it does instill nostalgia.<br />
    I give it a solid 8/10.</p>

<h3>World of Kanako</h3>

<p>A thriller/mystery Japanese movie about a detective investigating the disappearance of her daughter.<br />
    Contains lots of dark scenes and imagery so definitely not something for family night.<br />
    If you're into these things, I give it a big 9/10.</p>

<h3>The Irishman</h3>

<p>The best gangster movie I've watched in recent history.<br />
    We no longer get much of that genre nowadays especially with all time great actors and Martin Scorsese at the helm.<br />
    So if you're like me, grab a beer and enjoy this masterpiece on a good Sunday afternoon.<br />
    Easily a 9/10.</p>
